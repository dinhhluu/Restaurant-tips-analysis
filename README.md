# Restaurant-tips-analysis
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

## Data Overview
### Source of the Data
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv
 
### Description of the dataset
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.
It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

### How to Access the Data
You can download the CSV file directly from the above GitHub link.

## Main Goals
To understand which factors influence tipping behavior and visualize relationships among variables.

## Result
 #### Do people who smoke give more tips?
Based on the charts as we can see:
- The average tip amount for smokers appears slightly higher, but their sample size is smaller.
- Non-smokers tip more frequently, but with smaller amounts.
- Overall, the data is skewed toward lower tip values, indicating that most customers don’t tip much.
- This suggests that while smoking status may have a minor influence on tipping behavior, other factors — such as total bill amount, service quality, or group size — are likely to play a more significant role in determining tip values.

 #### Do males give more tips?
Based on the charts as we can see:
- Males tend to give higher tips, although most still tip at lower levels.
- Females tip more consistently, mostly in the range of 1–3 USD.
- Overall, the data is skewed toward lower tip values, indicating that most customers leave small tips.
- This suggests that gender may have a slight influence on tipping behavior, but other factors such as the total bill amount, group size, or service quality are likely to play a more significant role in determining tip amounts.

 #### Do weekends bring more tips?
 Based on the charts as we can see:
- Weekend customers tend to give higher tips and show greater variability in tipping behavior.
- Weekday customers usually tip less but more consistently.
- Overall, the data remains skewed toward lower tip values (1–4 USD), indicating that the average tip amount is not high.
- This suggests that the time of the week may influence tipping behavior, but other factors such as meal type (lunch/dinner), group size, or total bill amount may play a stronger role.

#### Do dinners bring more tips?
Based on the charts as we can see:
- Dinner customers tend to give higher and more variable tips, reflecting larger bills or different dining experiences.
- Lunch customers tip lower and more consistently, possibly due to smaller average bill values.
- Overall, the data remains skewed toward lower tip values (1–4 USD), indicating that the average tipping level is not high.
- This suggests that the time of day (lunch or dinner) has a noticeable impact on tipping behavior, particularly in relation to the total bill amount and the purpose of the meal.
